# BASIC PYAUTOGUI KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED
Only for educational purposes. I do not own any responsibilities because of these.

# Instructions

1-) Create a text file named "raw.txt" and paste your combos there. Its name MUST be "raw.txt".
2-) First, run "combosplitter.py", it will split your combos into files "usernames.txt" and "passwords.txt"
3-) Then edit bot.py file when your browser is open. You have to edit positions for your own screen. Using pyautogui.position() will help you to find your cursor position.
4-) When everything is ready to go, run bot.py and enter how many tries do you need. (for exmp. 500)

**) I'd suggest incognito mode which is way better. 
**) Keep each file in the same folder.
